The only commands you will need to run:

Make sure you clone this into your root directory.

cd HotspotSecurityTest
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh


systemctl restart apache2
/etc/init.d/apache2 start
hostapd hostapd.conf


In a new terminal type
dnsmasq -C dnsmasq.conf -d

If I knew how to automate into new tabs i'd do it. Maybe in the next day or so.
